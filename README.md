The basic concept of the application is to help travelers, tourists and other users to gain spatial orientation. 
The application will identify and present information about the POIs currently in the users FoV using marker-less geo-location based AR  environment and the mobile device camera. When the user points their camera at a POI, a location marker will be augmented onto their camera  view showing the name and distance of the POI from the user.
